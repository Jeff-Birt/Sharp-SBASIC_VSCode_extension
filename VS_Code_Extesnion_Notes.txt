Exzample for ZX81 BASIC: https://github.com/jsanjose/zxbasic-vscode/tree/master 

File types:
filename.pc1500.sbs -> SBASIC source for PC-1500, et al
filename.bas -> Tokenized BASIC
filename.asc -> Plain text (ASCII) BASIC

To fix line endings -
Replace CRLF with CR

: is seperator character. It seperates multiple statements on one line.
Line -> 10 PRINT "PRINT IN QUOTES":PRINT A:PRINT "COLON :":A = 5
Split at colon to get array of statements
Statements -> 10 PRINT "PRINT IN QUOTES"
              PRINT A
              PRINT "COLON :"
              A = 5
Split at space to get segements of statements
Segments of Statement 0 ->
              10
              PRINT
              "PRINT IN QUOTES"
Statement 0, Segment 0 is line number. 

Statement Loop (0 to #Statements)
    Segment Loop (0 to #Segments)
        If Statement = 0 & Segment = 0
            Decode line number
        Else
            Tokenize Segment
        EndIf
    Next Segment
Next Statement


To Tokenize - 
Do one line at a time
    Convert line number from ASCII to HB/LB [bytes 0-1]
    Insert line size byte (not including bytes 0-2) [byte 2]
    Replace keywords, not in quotes, with tokens
        String split on " "?
    Replace CRLF with LF
    Calculate line length and set that byte

To detokenize - 
Do one line at a time
    Replace CR with CRLF
    Replace tokens with keywords

To convert to ASCII - 
Do one line at a time
    Replace CRLF with CR
Add second CR to EOF
